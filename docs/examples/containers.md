# Container Diagram Examples

Hierarchical containers for architecture diagrams, microservices, and complex system structures.

## Simple Container

Basic container with nested shapes.

### DSL Code

```runiq
diagram "Simple Container Example" direction: TB

container "Frontend" {
  shape UI as @rect label: "Web UI"
  shape Router as @rect label: "Router"
}

container "Backend" {
  shape API as @rect label: "REST API"
  shape DB as @cyl label: "Database"
}

# Cross-container edges
UI -> Router
Router -> API
API -> DB
```

### Generated SVG

### Use Cases

- Logical grouping of components
- System boundaries
- Deployment zones
- Network segments

## C4 Context Diagram

System context showing external actors and systems.

### DSL Code

```runiq
diagram "C4 Context - Banking System" direction: TB

# Central system
shape BankingSystem as @rect
  label: "Internet Banking\nSystem"
  fillColor: "#1168bd"
  textColor: "#ffffff"

# External actors
actor Customer as @actor label: "Personal Banking\nCustomer"
actor Admin as @actor label: "Bank Staff"

# External systems
shape EmailSystem as @rect
  label: "Email System"
  fillColor: "#999999"
shape MainframeSystem as @rect
  label: "Mainframe Banking\nSystem"
  fillColor: "#999999"

# Relationships
Customer -> BankingSystem label: "Views accounts,\nmakes payments"
Admin -> BankingSystem label: "Manages customers"
BankingSystem -> EmailSystem label: "Sends email"
BankingSystem -> MainframeSystem label: "Gets account data"
```

### C4 Model Hierarchy

1. **Context**: System boundaries and external dependencies
2. **Container**: Applications and data stores
3. **Component**: Internal structure of containers
4. **Code**: Class-level details (optional)

## C4 Container Diagram

Zooming into the system to show containers.

### DSL Code

```runiq
diagram "C4 Container - Banking System" direction: TB

actor Customer as @actor label: "Personal Banking\nCustomer"

container "Internet Banking System" fillColor: "#e3f2fd" {

  shape WebApp as @rect
    label: "Web Application\n[JavaScript, React]"
    fillColor: "#1168bd"
    textColor: "#ffffff"

  shape API as @rect
    label: "API Application\n[Java, Spring Boot]"
    fillColor: "#1168bd"
    textColor: "#ffffff"

  shape DB as @cyl
    label: "Database\n[Oracle]"
    fillColor: "#1168bd"
    textColor: "#ffffff"
}

# External systems
shape EmailSystem as @rect
  label: "Email System\n[Microsoft Exchange]"
  fillColor: "#999999"

shape Mainframe as @rect
  label: "Mainframe System\n[IBM z/OS]"
  fillColor: "#999999"

# Relationships
Customer -> WebApp label: "Uses\n[HTTPS]"
WebApp -> API label: "Makes API calls\n[JSON/HTTPS]"
API -> DB label: "Reads/writes\n[JDBC]"
API -> EmailSystem label: "Sends email\n[SMTP]"
API -> Mainframe label: "Gets data\n[XML/HTTPS]"
```

### Technology Labels

Include technology stack in labels:

- `[JavaScript, React]` - Frontend
- `[Java, Spring Boot]` - Backend
- `[Oracle]` - Database
- `[HTTPS]`, `[JSON]`, `[JDBC]` - Protocols

## Microservices Architecture

Modern distributed system with multiple services.

### DSL Code

```runiq
diagram "Microservices Architecture" direction: TB

# API Gateway
shape Gateway as @rect
  label: "API Gateway\n[Nginx]"
  fillColor: "#ff9800"
  textColor: "#ffffff"

container "User Services" fillColor: "#e3f2fd" {
  shape Auth as @rect label: "Auth Service\n[Node.js]"
  shape User as @rect label: "User Service\n[Node.js]"
  shape AuthDB as @cyl label: "Auth DB\n[MongoDB]"
  shape UserDB as @cyl label: "User DB\n[PostgreSQL]"
}

container "Business Services" fillColor: "#fff3e0" {
  shape Order as @rect label: "Order Service\n[Java]"
  shape Payment as @rect label: "Payment Service\n[Java]"
  shape Inventory as @rect label: "Inventory Service\n[Go]"
  shape OrderDB as @cyl label: "Order DB\n[PostgreSQL]"
  shape PaymentDB as @cyl label: "Payment DB\n[PostgreSQL]"
  shape InventoryDB as @cyl label: "Inventory DB\n[Redis]"
}

container "Infrastructure" fillColor: "#e8f5e9" {
  shape MessageBroker as @rect label: "Message Broker\n[RabbitMQ]"
  shape ServiceDiscovery as @rect label: "Service Discovery\n[Consul]"
}

# External
actor Client as @actor label: "Mobile App"

# Connections
Client -> Gateway
Gateway -> Auth
Gateway -> User
Gateway -> Order
Gateway -> Payment
Gateway -> Inventory

Auth -> AuthDB
User -> UserDB
Order -> OrderDB
Payment -> PaymentDB
Inventory -> InventoryDB

Order -> MessageBroker
Payment -> MessageBroker
Inventory -> MessageBroker

Auth -> ServiceDiscovery
User -> ServiceDiscovery
Order -> ServiceDiscovery
Payment -> ServiceDiscovery
Inventory -> ServiceDiscovery
```

### Microservices Patterns

**Service Mesh**: Communication between services

- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Circuit breakers

**Event-Driven**: Asynchronous messaging

- Message queues
- Event bus
- Pub/sub

**Data Isolation**: Each service owns its data

- Separate databases
- No shared tables
- API-only access

## Three-Tier Architecture

Classic web application structure.

### DSL Code

```runiq
diagram "Three-Tier Web Application" direction: TB

container "Presentation Tier" fillColor: "#e3f2fd" {
  shape Browser as @rect label: "Web Browser"
  shape WebServer as @rect label: "Web Server\n[Apache]"
  shape StaticContent as @doc label: "Static Assets"
}

container "Application Tier" fillColor: "#fff3e0" {
  shape AppServer1 as @rect label: "App Server 1\n[Tomcat]"
  shape AppServer2 as @rect label: "App Server 2\n[Tomcat]"
  shape LoadBalancer as @rect label: "Load Balancer\n[HAProxy]"
}

container "Data Tier" fillColor: "#e8f5e9" {
  shape PrimaryDB as @cyl label: "Primary DB\n[MySQL]"
  shape ReplicaDB as @cyl label: "Replica DB\n[MySQL]"
  shape Cache as @cyl label: "Cache\n[Memcached]"
}

# Connections - Presentation to Application
Browser -> WebServer
WebServer -> LoadBalancer
LoadBalancer -> AppServer1
LoadBalancer -> AppServer2

# Application to Data
AppServer1 -> PrimaryDB
AppServer1 -> Cache
AppServer2 -> PrimaryDB
AppServer2 -> Cache
PrimaryDB -> ReplicaDB label: "replication"
```

## BPMN-Style Swimlanes

Process flow with organizational boundaries.

### DSL Code

```runiq
diagram "Purchase Order Process" direction: LR

container "Customer" fillColor: "#e3f2fd" {
  shape C1 as @rounded label: "Start"
  shape C2 as @rect label: "Submit\nOrder"
  shape C3 as @rhombus label: "Approved?"
  shape C4 as @hex label: "Receive\nGoods"
  shape C5 as @rounded label: "End"
}

container "Sales Department" fillColor: "#fff3e0" {
  shape S1 as @rect label: "Review\nOrder"
  shape S2 as @rect label: "Check\nInventory"
  shape S3 as @rect label: "Approve\nOrder"
  shape S4 as @doc label: "Generate\nInvoice"
}

container "Warehouse" fillColor: "#e8f5e9" {
  shape W1 as @rect label: "Pick\nItems"
  shape W2 as @rect label: "Pack\nOrder"
  shape W3 as @rect label: "Ship\nGoods"
}

# Process flow
C1 -> C2
C2 -> S1
S1 -> S2
S2 -> S3
S3 -> C3
C3[yes] -> S4
S4 -> W1
W1 -> W2
W2 -> W3
W3 -> C4
C4 -> C5
C3[no] -> C5
```

## Container Styling

### Background Colors

```runiq
container "Frontend" fillColor: "#e3f2fd" {
  # Light blue background
}

container "Backend" fillColor: "#fff3e0" {
  # Light orange background
}

container "Database" fillColor: "#e8f5e9" {
  # Light green background
}
```

### Border Styles

```runiq
container "Secure Zone"
  strokeColor: "#f44336"
  strokeWidth: 3
  lineStyle: dashed {
  # Dashed red border
}
```

### Nested Containers

```runiq
container "Data Center" {
  container "Rack 1" {
    shape Server1 as @rect
    shape Server2 as @rect
  }

  container "Rack 2" {
    shape Server3 as @rect
    shape Server4 as @rect
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

::: tip Color Coding
Use consistent colors for container types:

- **Blue** (#e3f2fd): Frontend/UI layers
- **Orange** (#fff3e0): Backend/API layers
- **Green** (#e8f5e9): Data/infrastructure layers
- **Gray** (#999999): External systems
  :::

::: tip Labels
Include technology stack in labels:

```runiq
shape API as @rect label: "API Service\n[Java, Spring Boot]"
```

Format: `Name\n[Technology]`
:::

::: tip Cross-Container Edges
Always connect shapes across containers:

```runiq
# ✅ Good
Frontend.UI -> Backend.API

# ❌ Avoid orphaned shapes
```
