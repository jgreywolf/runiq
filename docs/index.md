## Quick Example

```runiq
diagram "Auth Flow" direction: LR

style default fill:#f7f7ff stroke:#444
style decision fill:#fff7e6 stroke:#aa7700

shape User     as @actor   label:"Visitor"
shape Landing  as @rounded label:"Landing Page"
shape Check    as @rhombus label:"Signed up?" style:decision
shape Welcome  as @hex     label:"Welcome"

User -> Landing : visits
Landing -> Check
Check[yes] -> Welcome
Check[no]  -> Pricing : reads
```

<div style="margin: 2rem 0;">
  <img src="/examples/auth-flow.svg" alt="Auth Flow Diagram" style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">
</div>

## Use Cases

::: info Software Engineering
Create flowcharts, sequence diagrams, use case diagrams, class diagrams, state machines, ER diagrams, and architecture diagrams with clean, readable syntax.
:::

::: info Control Systems
Design PID controllers, feedback loops, and state-space models. Export to LaTeX for papers or Simulink for simulation.
:::

::: info Electrical Engineering
Define analog circuits and export SPICE netlists for simulation. Generate professional IEEE-standard schematics.
:::

::: info Digital Design
Create logic circuits with gates (AND, OR, XOR, etc.). Export Verilog HDL for synthesis and simulation.
