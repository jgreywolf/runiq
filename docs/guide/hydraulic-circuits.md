# Hydraulic Circuits

Create hydraulic circuit diagrams for fluid power systems with Runiq's hydraulic profile.

## Overview

Hydraulic circuits use pressurized fluid (typically oil) to transmit power and control movement. These diagrams follow ISO 1219-1 standards and are used in heavy machinery, construction equipment, aerospace, and industrial applications requiring high force and precise control.

## Best Practices

1. **System pressure** - Specify operating pressure (100-350 bar typical)
2. **Filtration** - Include filters on return lines (10-25 micron)
3. **Cooling** - Add heat exchangers for continuous operation
4. **Relief valves** - Always protect pump with relief valve
5. **Accumulators** - Use for shock dampening and energy storage
6. **Case drains** - Route motor/valve case drains to tank separately
7. **Line sizing** - Proper hose/tube diameter for flow rates
8. **Maintenance** - Plan for filter changes, fluid sampling

| -------------- | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Low pressure   | Pump wear, relief set too low    | Pump efficiency, relief setting    |
| Overheating    | Inadequate cooling, high load    | Cooler capacity, cycle time        |
| Slow operation | Low flow, restriction            | Flow rate, filter condition        |
| Cylinder drift | Internal leakage, counterbalance | Seal condition, valve setting      |
| Noise          | Cavitation, air in system        | Inlet restriction, reservoir level |
