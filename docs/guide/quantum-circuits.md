# Quantum Circuits Guide

**Status**: Production Ready  
**Last Updated**: October 17, 2025  
**Visual Standard**: IBM Qiskit

## Overview

Runiq supports quantum circuit diagrams in the style of IBM Qiskit, the industry-leading quantum computing framework. Quantum circuits visualize quantum algorithms by showing quantum gates operating on qubits over time.

### What are Quantum Circuits?

Unlike classical circuits that process bits (0 or 1), quantum circuits process **qubits** that can exist in superposition states. Quantum circuits show:

- **Qubit wires**: Horizontal lines representing quantum state evolution
- **Quantum gates**: Operations that manipulate qubit states
- **Multi-qubit gates**: Operations involving multiple qubits (entanglement)
- **Measurements**: Converting quantum states to classical bits
- **Time evolution**: Gates applied left-to-right in sequence

## Quick Start

### Simple Bell State Circuit

```runiq
diagram "Bell State Circuit" {

    style H0 fill:"#e8f5e9" stroke:"#000"
    style control0 fill:"#333" stroke:"#000"
    style target1 fill:"#fff" stroke:"#000"

    shape q0 as @qubitWire label:"q0" style: H0
    shape q1 as @qubitWire label:"q1" style: control0
    shape h as @gateH label:"H"
    shape cnot as @cnotTarget label:"⊕"
    shape ctrl as @controlDot label:"●"
    shape m0 as @measurement label:"M"
    shape m1 as @measurement label:"M"

    q0 -> h
    h -> ctrl
    ctrl -> m0
    q1 -> cnot
    cnot -> m1
}
```

**Result**: Creates entangled Bell state |Φ+⟩ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2

## Available Quantum Gates

### Single-Qubit Gates

#### Pauli Gates (Basis Gates)

| Gate  | Shape ID | Size    | Description           | Color     |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| **X** | `gateX`  | 20×20px | Bit flip (NOT gate)   | Light red |

| **Z** | `gateZ`  | 20×20px | Phase flip (1⟩ → -1⟩) | Light red |

**Usage**:

```runiq
diagram "Pauli Gates" {
  shape X_gate as @gateX label: "X" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"
  shape Y_gate as @gateY label: "Y" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"
  shape Z_gate as @gateZ label: "Z" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"
}
```

**Quantum Operations**:

- **X gate**: |0⟩ → |1⟩, |1⟩ → |0⟩ (classical NOT)
- **Y gate**: |0⟩ → i|1⟩, |1⟩ → -i|0⟩
- **Z gate**: |0⟩ → |0⟩, |1⟩ → -|1⟩ (phase flip)

---

#### Hadamard Gate (Superposition)

| Gate  | Shape ID | Size    | Description                 | Color       |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | --------------------------- | ----------- |
| **H** | `gateH`  | 20×20px | Creates equal superposition | Light green |

**Usage**:

```runiq
diagram "Hadamard Gate" {
  shape H_gate as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
}
```

**Quantum Operation**:

- |0⟩ → (|0⟩ + |1⟩)/√2
- |1⟩ → (|0⟩ - |1⟩)/√2

**Key Fact**: Hadamard is its own inverse (H·H = I)

---

#### Phase Gates

| Gate  | Shape ID | Size    | Description               | Color        |
| ----- | -------- | ------- | ------------------------- | ------------ |

}
```

**Quantum Operations**:

- **S gate**: |0⟩ → |0⟩, |1⟩ → i|1⟩ (adds π/2 phase)
- **T gate**: |0⟩ → |0⟩, |1⟩ → e^(iπ/4)|1⟩ (adds π/4 phase)

**Relationships**:

- S = T·T (two T gates equal one S gate)
- Z = S·S (two S gates equal one Z gate)

---

### Measurement & Utilities

#### Measurement

| Component | Shape ID      | Size    | Description                    | Color      |
| --------- | ------------- | ------- | ------------------------------ | ---------- |

  shape M1 as @measurement label: "M1" fill: "#e3f2fd" stroke: "#000"
}
```

**Measurement Operation**:

- Collapses quantum superposition to classical bit
- Probabilistic: P(0) = |α|², P(1) = |β|² for |ψ⟩ = α|0⟩ + β|1⟩
- Irreversible (destroys superposition)
- Outputs classical bit (0 or 1)

---

#### Barrier

| Component | Shape ID  | Size   | Description                           |
| --------- | --------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| **\|**    | `barrier` | 2×40px | Prevents gate reordering optimization |

**Usage**:

```runiq
diagram "Barrier Example" {
  shape barrier1 as @barrier label: "|"
  shape barrier2 as @barrier label: "|"
  shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "q0"
  shape H0 as @gateH label: "H"
  shape oracle as @rectangle label: "Oracle"

  q0 -> H0 -> barrier1 -> oracle
}
```

**Purpose**:

- Prevents quantum compiler from reordering gates across barrier
- Useful for separating circuit sections
- Marks algorithmic phases (preparation, oracle, diffusion)
- Visual separator in complex circuits

---

#### Qubit Wire

| Component | Shape ID    | Size   | Description                                  |
| --------- | ----------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| **—**     | `qubitWire` | 50×1px | Horizontal line representing qubit evolution |

**Usage**: Automatically rendered as connections between gates

**Convention**:

- Single solid line = qubit wire (quantum state)
- Double line = classical wire (after measurement)
- Time flows left-to-right along wire

---

## Circuit Patterns

### Pattern 1: Entanglement (Bell States)

Creates maximally entangled two-qubit states.

```runiq
diagram "Entanglement" {
    direction TB

    shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "Qubit 0: |0⟩"
    shape q1 as @qubitWire label: "Qubit 1: |0⟩"
    shape H0 as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
    shape controlId as @controlDot label: "●" fill: "#000" stroke: "#000"
    shape targetId as @cnotTarget label: "⊕" fill: "#fff" stroke: "#000"

    q0 -> H0 -> controlId
    q1 -> targetId
    controlId -> targetId
}
```

**Four Bell States**:

1. **|Φ+⟩** = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2: H on q0, CNOT(q0→q1)
2. **|Φ-⟩** = (|00⟩ - |11⟩)/√2: H on q0, Z on q0, CNOT(q0→q1)
3. **|Ψ+⟩** = (|01⟩ + |10⟩)/√2: X on q1, H on q0, CNOT(q0→q1)
4. **|Ψ-⟩** = (|01⟩ - |10⟩)/√2: X on q1, H on q0, Z on q0, CNOT(q0→q1)

---

### Pattern 2: Superposition (Equal Amplitude)

Creates equal superposition of all basis states.

```runiq
diagram "Superposition" {
    direction LR

    shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "q0"
    shape q1 as @qubitWire label: "q1"
    shape q2 as @qubitWire label: "q2"
    shape H0 as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
    shape H1 as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
    shape H2 as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"

    q0 -> H0
    q1 -> H1
    q2 -> H2
}
```

**Result**: |000⟩ → (|000⟩ + |001⟩ + |010⟩ + ... + |111⟩)/√8

**Use cases**:

- Grover's search initialization
- Quantum random number generation
- Amplitude amplification algorithms

---

### Pattern 3: Controlled Operations

Apply gate to target only if control is |1⟩.

```runiq
diagram "Controlled-Z Gate" {
    direction LR

    shape controlId as @controlDot label: "●" fill: "#000" stroke: "#000"
    shape Z_gate as @gateZ label: "Z" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"

    controlId -> Z_gate
}
```

**Common Controlled Gates**:

- **CNOT**: Controlled-X (⊕ symbol)
- **CZ**: Controlled-Z
- **CH**: Controlled-Hadamard
- **CS**: Controlled-S (phase)
- **CT**: Controlled-T

---

### Pattern 4: Phase Kickback

Control qubit acquires phase from controlled operation on target in superposition.

```runiq
diagram "Phase Kickback" {
    direction LR

    shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "q0"
    shape q1 as @qubitWire label: "q1"
    shape H_control as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
    shape controlId as @controlDot label: "●" fill: "#000" stroke: "#000"
    shape target_init as @gateX label: "X" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"
    shape X_target as @gateX label: "X" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"

    q0 -> H_control -> controlId
    q1 -> target_init -> X_target
    controlId -> X_target
}
```

**Key Insight**: Used in quantum algorithms (Grover, Shor) to mark states via phase.

---

### Pattern 5: Measurement + Classical Control

Measure qubits and apply gates conditionally based on classical results.

```runiq
diagram "Measurement + Classical Control" {
    direction LR

    shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "q0"
    shape q1 as @qubitWire label: "q1"
    shape q2 as @qubitWire label: "q2"
    shape M0 as @measurement label: "M0" fill: "#e3f2fd" stroke: "#000"
    shape M1 as @measurement label: "M1" fill: "#e3f2fd" stroke: "#000"
    shape X_gate as @gateX label: "X" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"
    shape Z_gate as @gateZ label: "Z" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"

    q0 -> M0
    q1 -> M1
    q2 -> X_gate -> Z_gate
    M1 -> X_gate label: "if M1=1"
    M0 -> Z_gate label: "if M0=1"
}
```

**Use cases**:

- Quantum teleportation corrections
- Quantum error correction
- Adaptive measurements

## Best Practices

### 1. Gate Ordering

✅ **DO**: Order gates left-to-right (time sequence)

```runiq
diagram "Gate Ordering" {
    direction LR
    shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "q0"
    shape H as @gateH label: "H"
    shape X as @gateX label: "X"
    shape Z as @gateZ label: "Z"
    shape M as @measurement label: "M"

    q0 -> H -> X -> Z -> M
}
```

❌ **DON'T**: Place gates out of order (measurement should be last)

---

### 2. Vertical Alignment

✅ **DO**: Align multi-qubit gates vertically

```runiq
diagram "Vertical Alignment" {
    direction TB
    shape controlId as @controlDot label: "●" fill: "#000" stroke: "#000"
    shape targetId as @cnotTarget label: "⊕" fill: "#fff" stroke: "#000"

    controlId -> targetId
}
```

❌ **DON'T**: Misalign control and target (makes connections unclear)

---

### 3. Label Gates Clearly

✅ **DO**: Use descriptive labels

```runiq
diagram "Clear Labels" {
    shape H_init as @gateH label: "H (init)" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
    shape H_diff as @gateH label: "H (diff)" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
}
```

❌ **DON'T**: Use ambiguous labels like H1, H2 without context

---

### 4. Use Barriers to Separate Phases

✅ **DO**: Mark algorithm phases

```runiq
diagram "Grover's Algorithm Phases" {
    direction LR
    shape q0 as @qubitWire label: "q0"
    shape H_init as @gateH label: "H"
    shape barrier1 as @barrier label: "|"
    shape oracle as @rectangle label: "Oracle"
    shape barrier2 as @barrier label: "|"
    shape diffusion as @rectangle label: "Diffusion"
    shape barrier3 as @barrier label: "|"
    shape M as @measurement label: "M"

    q0 -> H_init -> barrier1 -> oracle -> barrier2 -> diffusion -> barrier3 -> M
}
```

---

### 5. Color Code by Function

✅ **DO**: Use consistent colors

```runiq
diagram "Color Coding" {
    shape H_gate as @gateH label: "H" fill: "#e8f5e9" stroke: "#000"
    shape X_gate as @gateX label: "X" fill: "#ffebee" stroke: "#000"
    shape S_gate as @gateS label: "S" fill: "#fff9c4" stroke: "#000"
    shape M_gate as @measurement label: "M" fill: "#e3f2fd" stroke: "#000"
}
```

**Suggested Color Scheme**:

- **Green** (#e8f5e9): Hadamard (superposition)
- **Red** (#ffebee): Pauli gates (X, Y, Z)
- **Yellow** (#fff9c4): Phase gates (S, T)
- **Blue** (#e3f2fd): Measurement
- **Purple** (#f3e5f5): Multi-qubit gates
- **Black** (#000): Control dots

## FAQ

**Q: Can I run these circuits on a real quantum computer?**  
A: Runiq provides visualizations only. Export the circuit structure and recreate in Qiskit/Cirq for execution on IBM/Google quantum hardware.

**Q: Why do some gates have funny symbols (⊕, ✕)?**  
A: These are standard quantum computing notations:

- ⊕ = XOR (CNOT target)
- ✕ = SWAP
- ● = Control qubit
- | = Barrier

**Q: What's the difference between classical and quantum gates?**  
A: Classical gates are deterministic and irreversible. Quantum gates are:

- Reversible (unitary transformations)
- Can create superposition
- Can create entanglement
- Preserve quantum information

**Q: How do I create custom quantum gates?**  
A: Combine primitive gates (X, Y, Z, H, S, T, CNOT) to create any quantum operation. All single-qubit gates can be decomposed into rotations. All multi-qubit gates can be decomposed into CNOT + single-qubit gates.

**Q: What's the maximum number of qubits I can visualize?**  
A: No hard limit, but readability decreases beyond 5-6 qubits. For large circuits, consider:

- Breaking into subcircuits
- Using circuit folding
- Focusing on key algorithmic sections
