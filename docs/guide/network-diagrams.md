# Network Diagrams

Create network topology and infrastructure diagrams with Runiq's diagram profile.

## Overview

Network diagrams visualize computer networks, infrastructure layouts, and system connectivity. Runiq provides specialized shapes for servers, routers, switches, firewalls, and cloud services.

## Key Shapes

- **Server**: `@server` - Physical or virtual servers
- **Router**: `@router` - Network routing devices
- **Switch**: `@switch` - Network switches
- **Firewall**: `@firewall` - Security appliances
- **Load Balancer**: `@loadBalancer` - Traffic distribution
- **Cloud**: `@cloud` - Cloud services
- **Storage**: `@storage` - Network storage devices

See the [Shape Reference - Network Shapes](/reference/shapes#_8-network-shapes-7-shapes) for the complete list.

## Basic Network Topology

```runiq
diagram "Office Network" {
  direction TB

  shape internet as @cloud label: "Internet"
  shape router as @router label: "Router"
  shape firewall as @firewall label: "Firewall"
  shape switch as @switch label: "Core Switch"
  shape server1 as @server label: "Web Server"
  shape server2 as @server label: "DB Server"
  shape storage as @storage label: "NAS"

  internet -> router
  router -> firewall
  firewall -> switch
  switch -> server1
  switch -> server2
  switch -> storage
}
```

## Three-Tier Web Architecture

    shape fw1 as @firewall label: "Firewall 1"
    shape lb1 as @loadBalancer label: "LB 1"

    shape db1 as @server label: "DB Primary"
  }

  container secondary as @systemBoundary label: "Secondary Data Center" {
    shape router2 as @router label: "Router 2"
    shape fw2 as @firewall label: "Firewall 2"
    shape lb2 as @loadBalancer label: "LB 2"
    shape web2 as @server label: "Web 2"
    shape db2 as @server label: "DB Standby"
  }

  internet -> router1 label: "Primary"
  internet -> router2 label: "Failover"
  router1 -> fw1
  router2 -> fw2
  fw1 -> lb1
  fw2 -> lb2
  lb1 -> web1
  lb2 -> web2
  web1 -> db1
  web2 -> db2
  db1 -> db2 label: "Replication" style: { strokeDasharray: "5,5" }
}
```

  shape remote as @server label: "Remote\nWorker"
  shape vpn as @cloud label: "VPN Gateway"
  shape fw as @firewall label: "Corporate\nFirewall"
  shape router as @router label: "Core Router"

  container corp as @systemBoundary label: "Corporate Network" {

## Styling

Apply consistent network diagram styling:

```runiq
diagram "Styled Network" {
  direction LR

  shape internet as @cloud label: "Internet" fill: "#dbeafe" stroke: "#3b82f6"
  shape fw as @firewall label: "Firewall" fill: "#fee2e2" stroke: "#dc2626"
  shape switch as @switch label: "Switch" fill: "#fef3c7" stroke: "#f59e0b"
  shape server as @server label: "Server" fill: "#d1fae5" stroke: "#10b981"

  internet -> fw style: { stroke: "#3b82f6", strokeWidth: 2 }
  fw -> switch style: { stroke: "#dc2626", strokeWidth: 2 }
  switch -> server style: { stroke: "#10b981", strokeWidth: 2 }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use standard symbols** - Leverage recognizable network icons
2. **Show hierarchy** - Organize by network layers (edge, core, access)
3. **Label connections** - Indicate protocols, VLANs, or bandwidth
4. **Use containers** - Group devices by location or security zone
5. **Color code** - Different colors for security zones (DMZ, internal, external)
6. **Show redundancy** - Indicate primary/backup paths
7. **Include IP ranges** - Add subnet information in labels
8. **Document protocols** - Show HTTPS, SSH, RDP, etc. on connections

## Common Patterns

### Edge/Core/Access

- **Edge**: Internet-facing devices (routers, firewalls)
- **Core**: High-speed backbone (core switches, routers)
- **Access**: End-user devices (access switches, servers)

### Security Zones

- **Internet**: External, untrusted
- **DMZ**: Public-facing services
- **Internal**: Corporate network
- **Management**: Admin access only

### Redundancy

- **Active/Active**: Both paths used simultaneously
- **Active/Passive**: Backup path for failover
- **N+1**: Extra capacity for redundancy
