## TIER 3: HIGH EFFORT (1-3 weeks each)

### Issue 21: C4 Architecture Diagrams

````markdown
## 🎯 Feature: C4 Architecture Diagrams

### Description

Add support for C4 model (Context, Container, Component, Code) architecture diagrams with hierarchical containers.

### Implementation Requirements

**Effort:** 1-2 weeks  
**Priority:** High (Software architecture standard)  
**Complexity:** High (needs hierarchical containers)

#### Phase 1: Hierarchical Containers (1 week)

**This is the critical architecture enhancement!**

- [ ] Add container/subgraph support to AST
- [ ] Nested container parsing in DSL
- [ ] ELK hierarchical layout
- [ ] Container rendering with z-index
- [ ] Cross-container edge routing

#### Phase 2: C4-Specific Shapes (2 days)

- [ ] Person (external user)
- [ ] Software System (high-level)
- [ ] Container (app, database, etc.)
- [ ] Component (code module)
- [ ] Relationship arrows with technology labels

#### Phase 3: C4 Levels (2 days)

```runiq
# Level 1: System Context
diagram c4-context "Banking System"
  person Customer
  system BankingSystem
  system EmailSystem external

  Customer -> BankingSystem label:"Uses"
  BankingSystem -> EmailSystem label:"Sends emails via"

# Level 2: Container
diagram c4-container "Banking System"
  container WebApp type:web label:"Web Application"
  container API type:api label:"API"
  container DB type:database label:"Database"

  WebApp -> API label:"Makes API calls [HTTPS]"
  API -> DB label:"Reads/Writes [SQL]"

# Level 3: Component
diagram c4-component "API Container"
  component LoginController
  component SecurityComponent
  component EmailComponent

  LoginController -> SecurityComponent
  LoginController -> EmailComponent
```
````

2. Add "quick-win" label
3. Create Tier 2 next with "medium-effort" label
4. Create Tier 3 with "high-effort" label
5. Hold Tier 4 for future consideration

### Suggested GitHub Labels:

- `enhancement`
- `diagram-type`
- `quick-win`
- `medium-effort`
- `high-effort`
- `engineering` (for P&ID, pneumatic, etc.)
- `visualization` (for charts)

**Would you like me to:**

1. Generate a script to bulk-create these issues via GitHub API?
2. Create a CSV file for GitHub's issue import feature?
3. Provide more detailed templates for specific diagram types?
