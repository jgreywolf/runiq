## Parameter Reference

### Array Parameters

Most glyphsets use array parameters for items:

```runiq
// Using named items
glyphset basicProcess "Example" {
  step "First"
  step "Second"
  step "Third"
}

// Alternative array syntax (if supported)
glyphset basicProcess "Example" {
  steps: ["First", "Second", "Third"]
}
```

### Nested Parameters

Some glyphsets support nesting:

```runiq
glyphset orgChart "Hierarchy" {
  person "Root" {
    person "Child 1" {
      person "Grandchild 1"
      person "Grandchild 2"
    }
    person "Child 2"
  }
}
```

### Complex Parameters

Advanced glyphsets may use structured data:

```runiq
glyphset detailedProcess "Complex" {
  item "Phase 1 | Task A | Task B | Task C"
  item "Phase 2 | Task D | Task E"
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Choose the right glyphset** - Match pattern to your message
2. **Use consistent themes** - Same theme across related diagrams
3. **Keep it simple** - 3-7 items optimal for most glyphsets
4. **Clear labels** - Brief, descriptive text
5. **Test with data** - Verify with real content, not placeholders

## When to Use Diagram Profiles Instead

Switch from glyphsets to diagram profiles when you need:

- **Custom shapes** - Beyond standard glyphset shapes
- **Complex connections** - Multi-directional or conditional
- **Technical notation** - UML, BPMN, circuit symbols
- **Fine control** - Precise positioning and styling
- **Detailed metadata** - Attributes, annotations, properties
