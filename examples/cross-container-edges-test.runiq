// Test case 1: Edge between nodes in different containers
container "Frontend" {
  shape web as @browser label: "Web App"
}

container "Backend" {
  shape api as @service label: "API Service"
  shape db as @database label: "Database"
  
  // Internal edge (should work)

}

// Cross-container edge (may not work)
web -> api

// Test case 2: Edge from standalone node to container node
shape client as @actor label: "Client"

container "Services" {
