# Use Case Diagram Examples

UML use case diagrams showing actors interacting with system functionality.

## âœ¨ NEW Features! 

### UML Relationship Stereotypes
- **<<include>>** - Required dependency (dashed arrow, open head)
- **<<extend>>** - Optional extension (dashed arrow, open head)
- **<<uses>>** - Dependency (dashed arrow, open head)
- **<<implements>>** - Interface realization (dashed arrow, hollow head)

### Line Styles
- **solid** - Standard associations, generalizations
- **dashed** - Dependencies, includes, extends
- **dotted** - Alternative styling

### Arrow Types
- **standard** - Filled triangle (associations)
- **hollow** - Open triangle (generalization/inheritance, realization)
- **open** - V-shaped (dependencies)
- **none** - No arrow (bidirectional or undirected)

## Features Demonstrated

### Shapes Used
- **Actors**: `actor` - stick figure representing system users
- **Use Cases**: `ellipse-wide` - horizontal ovals representing system functionality  
- **System Boundary**: `system-boundary` - dotted rectangle grouping related use cases
- **Actor Variants**: `actor-circle`, `actor-rect`, `person` - alternative actor styles

### Connections
- **Associations**: Simple arrows showing actor-use case relationships
- **Use Case Dependencies**: Arrows between use cases (include/extend relationships)
- **External System Interactions**: Labeled connections to external actors

## Examples

- Customer, admin, and vendor actors
- Product management use cases
- Checkout workflow with payment processing
- Inventory synchronization with external vendor

**Run:**
```bash
runiq ecommerce.runiq -o ecommerce.svg
```

### simple.runiq
Minimal example for learning:
- Single actor
- Two use cases in system boundary
- Basic associations

**Run:**
```bash
runiq simple.runiq -o simple.svg
```

## Relationship Syntax

### Basic Association
```runiq
actor Customer "Customer"
ellipse-wide PlaceOrder "Place Order"

Customer -> PlaceOrder
```

### <<include>> Relationship
Required dependency - base use case ALWAYS includes the other:
```runiq
ellipse-wide Checkout "Checkout"
ellipse-wide ValidatePayment "Validate Payment"

Checkout -> ValidatePayment stereotype: "include" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open
```

### <<extend>> Relationship
Optional extension - extending use case adds behavior to base:
```runiq
ellipse-wide CompletePurchase "Complete Purchase"
ellipse-wide PrintReceipt "Print Receipt"

PrintReceipt -> CompletePurchase stereotype: "extend" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open
```

### Generalization (Inheritance)
Actor or use case specialization:
```runiq
actor OnlineCustomer "Online Customer"
actor Customer "Customer"

OnlineCustomer -> Customer lineStyle: solid arrowType: hollow
```

### Custom Combinations
```runiq
# Dependency with custom stereotype
A -> B stereotype: "uses" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open label: "invokes"

# Association with label
A -> B lineStyle: solid arrowType: standard label: "manages"

# Generalization
Child -> Parent lineStyle: solid arrowType: hollow
```

## Use Case Diagram Best Practices

### When to Use
- **Requirements Analysis**: Capture functional requirements from user perspective
- **Stakeholder Communication**: Visual overview of system capabilities
- **Scope Definition**: Define system boundaries and external interfaces
- **Test Planning**: Identify scenarios for acceptance testing

### Diagram Structure
1. **Actors** (External entities):
   - Primary actors: Initiate use cases (customers, users)
   - Secondary actors: Respond to system (external systems, services)
   - Use descriptive role names

2. **System Boundary**:
   - Contains all use cases provided by the system
   - Label with system name
   - Keep boundary simple and rectangular

3. **Use Cases** (System functionality):
   - Name with verb phrases (e.g., "Place Order", "Generate Report")
   - Keep granularity consistent
   - Focus on user goals, not implementation

4. **Relationships**:
   - **Association**: Actor uses functionality (solid line)
   - **Include**: One use case always includes another (dashed arrow with <<include>>)
   - **Extend**: Optional extension of use case (dashed arrow with <<extend>>)
   - **Generalization**: Actor/use case specialization (solid arrow)

### Tips
- **Keep it Simple**: 5-10 use cases per diagram maximum
- **Actor Placement**: Primary actors on left, secondary on right
- **Consistent Naming**: Use active voice for use cases
- **Avoid Implementation Details**: Focus on "what" not "how"
- **Group Related Use Cases**: Use system boundaries to organize

## Shape Reference

### Actor Shapes
```
actor A1 "Customer"           # Standard stick figure
actor-circle A2 "Admin"       # Actor in circle
actor-rect A3 "System"        # Actor in rectangle  
person P1 "User"              # Alternative person icon
```

### Use Case Shapes
```
ellipse-wide UC1 "Login"      # Horizontal oval (standard)
rounded UC2 "Process"         # Rounded rectangle (alternative)
```

### System Boundary
```
system-boundary Sys "My System" {
  # Use cases go here
  ellipse-wide UC1 "Feature 1"
  ellipse-wide UC2 "Feature 2"
}
```

## UML Relationship Reference

### Association (Actor to Use Case)
**Visual**: Solid line with filled arrow  
**Syntax**: `Actor -> UseCase`  
**Meaning**: Actor participates in or initiates the use case

```runiq
Customer -> PlaceOrder lineStyle: solid arrowType: standard
```

### <<include>> (Use Case Dependency)
**Visual**: Dashed line with open arrow  
**Syntax**: `BaseUseCase -> IncludedUseCase stereotype: "include" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open`  
**Meaning**: Base use case always includes the behavior of included use case  
**Direction**: From base â†’ to included

```runiq
Checkout -> ValidatePayment stereotype: "include" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open
```

### <<extend>> (Use Case Extension)
**Visual**: Dashed line with open arrow  
**Syntax**: `ExtendingUseCase -> BaseUseCase stereotype: "extend" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open`  
**Meaning**: Extending use case adds optional behavior to base use case  
**Direction**: From extending â†’ to base (opposite of include!)

```runiq
PrintReceipt -> CompletePurchase stereotype: "extend" lineStyle: dashed arrowType: open
```

### Generalization (Inheritance)
**Visual**: Solid line with hollow arrow  
**Syntax**: `SpecializedActor -> GeneralActor lineStyle: solid arrowType: hollow`  
**Meaning**: Specialized actor/use case inherits from general actor/use case  
**Direction**: From child â†’ to parent

```runiq
OnlineCustomer -> Customer lineStyle: solid arrowType: hollow
```
